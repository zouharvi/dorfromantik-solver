# Dorfromantik Solver 🏡

A small tool to help with the placement of tiles in <a href="https://toukana.com/dorfromantik/">Dorfromantik</a> because mid- and late-game is just scrolling through the map and finding highest yield card placement.
This tool is just for fun (and contains many bugs because it was made in a few hours.).
Please don't use it to ruin the fun of the game. 🙂

Use <b>R</b> and <b>A</b> to rotate your tile and turn the autorotate on/off.

Some things are not working -- this is just a prototype.
It's available online here: [vilda.net/s/dorfromantik-solver/](https://vilda.net/s/dorfromantik-solver/).

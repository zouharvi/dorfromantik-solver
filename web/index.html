      A small tool to help with the placement of tiles in <a href="https://toukana.com/dorfromantik/">Dorfromantik</a> because mid- and late-game is just scrolling through the map and finding highest yield card placement.
      This tool is just for fun (and contains many bugs because it was made in a few hours.).
      Please don't use it to ruin the fun of the game.
      <br><br>
      Use <b>R</b> and <b>A</b> to rotate your tile and turn the autorotate on/off.
      <br><br>
      Some things are not working. See the code <a href="https://github.com/zouharvi/dorfromantik-solver">here</a>.
